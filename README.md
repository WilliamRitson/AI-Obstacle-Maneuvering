# About
This repository is for the A.I Obstacle Maneuvering team in CMPS 140 (A.I) Spring 2018.
The goal is to use reinforcement learning to train a physics-based agent to maneuver through obstacles.
The repository contains agents designed to run on OpenAI gym environments.

# Requirements
The code runs in the Anaconda environment (python 3.x) with the following additions

1. The tensorflow package `pip install tensorflow`
2. The keras package `pip install keras`

Some gym environments may require additional packages.

# Running
You can run the example enviroment with `python test.py` the agents can be used on other enviroments by simply passing them the name of the desired enviroment.
